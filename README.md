# Machine_Learning_Project
Final project of the course Machine Learning

## Expectation Maximization Algorithm
In this repo there is the implementation of the EM Algorithm to perform classification and the estimation of the parameters of the model. The code is written in Matlab

## DataSets
The algorithm was tested over three different datasets:
  1) Synthetic dataset: dataset created by me containing four classes
  2) Iris dataset: dataset with 3 classes, taken from the UCI repository
  3) Seed dataset: dataset with 3 classes, taken from the UCI repository
